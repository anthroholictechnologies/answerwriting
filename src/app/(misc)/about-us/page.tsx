                discipline of Anthropology! We are a team of passionate
                Anthropology enthusiasts who believe in the power of education
                to create a positive change in the world. Anthroholic started as
                a YouTube & Telegram channel in 2021 to cater the needs of UPSC
                aspirants who were preparing for their Optional subject. We
                found that the content related to Anthropology is missing on the
                internet and the Idea of Anthroholic was born to establish it as
                a resource for anyone interested in learning Anthropology.
              </p>

              <p>

                financial status. We understand that Anthropology can be a
                daunting subject, with its many subfields and complex theories.
                Thatâ€™s why we have made it our mission to provide free,
                high-quality education in Anthropology to anyone who is

                and passion for Anthropology, we can inspire others to develop
